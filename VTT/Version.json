  "changelog": {
    "1.0.0": "Initial alpha release",
    "1.1.0": "Initial beta release",
    "1.1.1": "Fixed name being null for new accounts. Fixed a crash with permanent markers when changing map. Fixed chat issues with null strings. Fixed numpad 3 and 9 movement on the Z axis while in 2D mode. Added the ability to pause animated gifs. Last IP/Port pair for server connections are now saved. Added automatic updater.",
    "1.1.2": "The server/client connection is now explicitly keepalive. Added a disconnected screen and a reason for disconnect. Fixed chat message crash. Made the code more robust to disconnects and general network state changes.",
    "1.1.3": "Added keepalive ping packets. Fixed a crash with turn tracker entry comparison. Added more logging for integrations. Added map backups. Added a network profiling/information tool for the server host. Added the ability to ban clients. Chat tooltips for expression rolls now explicitly show all non-nested roll results whenever possible.",
    "1.1.4": "Removed the NulEng dependency. Moved to github for version control and updates. Fixed issues with sun shadows not being in the correct position.",
    "1.1.5": "Added credits. Status effects are now always drawn for object owners. Asset uploading will not crash the app anymore. Fixed %s and other c++ formatting crashing the client in UI text. Fixed UI texture border issues. Fixed crash when changing maps while manipulating objects. Fixed server crash on client-server version mismatch. Fixed previews not generated for image assets.",
    "1.1.6": "Fixed compressed image uploading causing heap corruption. Roll tooltip generator now generates tooltips for compound rolls. Camera snap/default position now includes 2d zoom level. Added network timeout handling.",
    "1.1.7": "Fixed texture compression parameter not applying. Added a d10 option to rolls. Fixed a crash with changing object properties on a different map than other clients.",
    "1.1.8": "Major code refactoring and some optimizations. Particle surface emission is now weighted based on the total triangle area for a mesh, not just the number of triangles. Potentially fixed UI issues by making ImGui calls consistent. Fixed shader recompilation issues.",
    "1.1.9": "Fixed the hotkeys for movement being broken",
    "1.1.10": "Added shader error reporting. Fixed shaders not compiling on intel gpus. Fixed a server-side crash when clients disconnected through the ui. Added missing language entries. Optimized language translate function. Added custom name templates for objects. Added settings to disable particles. Updated dependencies. Added client secret for profile validation. Fixed the server logger being prefixed as client.",
    "1.1.11": "Added server chat backups. Updated ImGui library. Fixed gui inconsistency on right-click menu for objects for non-admins. Added user colors to network panel. Fixed incorrect camera snapping for 2D maps. Moved to modern ImGuiIO. Added tools for explicit camera control for users without MMB. Optimized the rendering pipeline to use UBOs. Changed shadows to use PCF from built-in shadow samplers and added settings to control the quality of the PCF. Added the ability to control billboarding for particle systems. Fixed a crash that could occur with custom nameplate rendering. Made particle mesh surface emission mode account for triangle area, making small triangles less likely to emit particles resulting in uniform particle emission across the mesh. Added support for various unicode characters (approx ~500). Added shader graph editor and custom shaders (not attachable to objects yet).",
    "1.1.12": "Fixed preview generation not using UBOs. Switched both server and client to use SendAsync. Moved from hardware gamma correction to explicit and allowed for its adjustment in the settings.",
    "1.1.13": "Made the updater use a new stream explicitly, may fix the corrupted directory issue. Fixed an issue with the asset browser crashing in rare circumstances. Added settings to enable/disable UBOs for old graphics cards. Padded the UBO to 416 bytes per NVidia driver complaint. Added a sun light color property.",
    "1.1.14": "Changed the turn tracker controls to render entries in a child element. Changed the camera for 2D maps to use less Z depth. Added compression for network packets.",
    "1.2.0": "Object bounding boxes now take model node rotation into account. Fully implemented custom shaders and nodegraph editor. Updated the readme to include a guide on custom shaders. Added a setting to disable custom shaders.",
    "1.2.1": "Added a material index to shadergraph. Added logic shader nodes. Added a shader compilation error handler. Added more various shader graph nodes. Increased the shader depth limit.",
    "1.2.2": "Fixed missing name entries for logic nodes causing a crash. Implemented extra textures for custom shaders (up to 64 custom textures/shader).",
    "1.2.3": "Made deferred rendering more explicit and consistent across drivers. Added a 16bit vs 32bit precision option. Made updater wait for content availability before downloading it. Added the ability to open the latest release download page in browser with ctrl held. Added settings for MSAA and unfocused framerate. Added shadow casting property to objects. Added the info object property to objects. Fixed geometry above Z 1 always being considered shaded with sun disabled. Added the ability to only move logged-in clients to a map if ctrl is held. Reworked the maps ui to use nested folder-like structure. Added a cluster emission mode for particles.",
    "1.2.4": "Fixed shader graph dot product not working. Rolled back VK changes due to AMD auto-including VK headers when compiling shaders, regardless of OpenGL context requested, resulting in an error. Fixed the server sending less than 24 messages to a client if said client couldn't see the message due to message destination mismatch. Added FOV control to the settings. Optimized asset and map loading for the server - assets are multi-threaded now, and have a dedicated server cache, and maps are lazily loaded only on client demand. Fixed custom nameplate textures not scaling to the nameplate UI size. When leaving measurements with rmb, a new measurement is automatically started from the end of the previous one, making it easier to chain measurements. Added an option to make measurements not show their author nor their size, making them a replacement for in-world drawing. Added a polyline (path) measurement tool which measures the total distance for a path. Added an eraser measurement tool which can conditionally erase measurements left by clients (old rmb functionality still present). Reworked how the turn tracker is drawn - removed the background, moved the collapse arrow, textured the turn separator, fixed a bug with it drawing twice, reworked portrait backgrounds, added a portrait frame which indicates the current turn better than the old outline, added particles (disabled by default). Reworked how non-compact bars are drawn - slightly rounded their corners, made the numbers more visible with an outline, centered them and fixed the spacing issue cutting off the lower portion of the numbers. Fixed an issue where the custom nameplate wouldn't leave appropriate room for non-compact bars, making them cutoff. Fixed an issue where portraits for image-based objects would be compressed (the model based ones weren't which resulted in image quality difference). Added a description to roll options in the roll window and fixed the location of the tooltip text in the send image popup window. Added the changelog to the main menu.",
    "1.2.5": "Fixed creating a new map not updating on the server resulting in inability to move to it before restart. Fixed bad scale data causing a matrix error when drawing measurements. Fixed server cache breaking asset updating. Copy-Pasting objects now correctly copies the tint color. Reworked aura rendering, added explicit 2d map proper sorting. Fixed incorrect triangulation for the FOW by implementing Ear Clipping. Added notes to objects and rearranged the ui a bit. Added FOW precision to particles. Added the ability to duplicate particle systems from the asset manager. FOW now hides objects from selection. Added sounds. Objects that are even in scale now snap to the grid better. Made object grid occupancy highlight scale with object's scale. Fixed incorrect nameplate ui size without bars. Turn tracker is now scrollable."
